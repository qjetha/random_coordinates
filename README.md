Simple python program that uses the geopandas library to read in a district level shapefile, and for each district attribute generate a list of random coordinate points within that shapefile. The random allocation is subject to two constraints - a minimum specified distance between the point and the polygon boundary and a minimum specified distance between the point and all the other randomly generated points. 

After a set number of failed random points (failed to satisfy the constaints), the parameter constraints will slightly relax. In this way, the first points that are assigned are "better" in the sense that they meet the most strict constraints. In this manner even if a district polygon is small and/or shaped weirdly (e.g. Karachi districts), random points will still be assigned after the constraints continually relax.
